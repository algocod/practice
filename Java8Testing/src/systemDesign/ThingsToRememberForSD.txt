Availability of Database
Scalability of Database

Systems are made highly Available using replication but then Replication leads to loss of consistency.

Cassandra Explained which is highly Available and Scalable:
> Instead of master slave , it has a ring of nodes in a cluster and a majority of them form a quorum. 
> Hence no single point of failure.
> Wide column based database , able to handle high volumes of  read and writes and able to scale to thousands of nodes.
