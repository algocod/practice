Streaming data to be sorted and stored with instant access and logN max for top K search results.
> PriorityQ is a makeshift solution which caters only to static input
> For dynamic input , use TreeMap , which stores Key and value as Node that has value, left, right as Node. 
TreeHashMap allows for instant access and the sorting is based on the Node.Value which allows for sorting

The above will have two parts to the solution , first to store elements in hashmap like 
hmp.put(4, new Node(4,1)); // Node will have key and frequency , Node {int val , int freq , Node left , Node right}

Now a TreeMap of all the Node objects being put in hashMap and hte comparator will be based on the Node.freq 
At any point in time traversing the tree map will give top K elements. The complexity of sorting everytime a node is updated is 
LogK but worst case where all elements are not balanced properly like a LInked list will be O(n)
and for N elements it will be NLogK or N * O(N), worst case will be N^2 where all N elements are distinct and already sorted .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 , it will make up a LL and each addition will be N traversals and for 1 million distinct sorted elements , T = O(N^2)

	preorder like node,left right with comma separate values and end points being written as null,
	now parse the input to make it linkedList.
	pop the first element that will be the Root of hte tree
	makeTree(LinkedList ll)
	if(ll.value=="null")
	return null;
	
	String val = ll.pop().value();
	Node n = new Node(val);
	n.left = makeTree(ll);
	n.right = makeTree(ll);
	
> Meeting Rooms needed given start and end times of different meetings. 
	sort the input array by start time first
	put it in a Min heap based on start time 
	and if startT>endT of peek() then poll it out else add to the heap
	size of heap is number of rooms required

Use JSON input and metadata that keeps defining the end result.
